# distra

distra is a tool for building websites.

Use it to serve static files and directories, and to give servers running on your computer nice URLs. Set up hosts and routes using JSON, and then feel like a boss.

It also adds to your hosts file (safely) so you never have worry about that either!

### Why?

I had so many servers running, particularly serving static files, that I never knew what was being served and on which port. So I built this so I'd never have to care again!

## Super-quick setup

Install and start distra on port 80:

```shell
$ npm install -g distra
$ sudo distra 80
```

In another window, find some static files and set distra up to serve them:

```shell
$ cd some-project
$ distra add
Host http://some-project/ pointing to /path/to/some-project added.
```

Done.

## Install

Distra requires:

* OS X (yeah, sorry)
* Node
* npm

```bash
$ npm install -g distra
$ distra
```

Wahey! You're up, but it won't do much yet â€“ you need to configure it.

## Configuration

Distra is configured from the `.distra.json` file in your home directory, but you don't ever have to touch this file if you don't want to.

### Adding a host

To add a host, use `distra add`.

```bash
$ distra add [host] [directory or url]
```

The `host` and `directory or url` are both optional. If you omit `directory or url` distra will serve your current directory.

If you omit both, distra will serve the **current directory** with the **name of the directory** as the host.

#### Try it:

Head to a directory with some `.html` files in it, lets say it's called `website`.

```bash
$ distra add
```

Assuming distra is started (just use `distra`), you will find that you can go to `http://website:9876/` to access those files.

### Removing a host

To remove a host, use `distra rm`.

```bash
$ distra rm [host]
```

Again, `host` is optional - it will just use the directory name if you don't supply one.

### The config file

Distra writes its configuration to a config file found at `~/.distra.json`.

Here's an example.

```json
{
  "mysite.dev":   "localhost:4000",
  "project":      "/Users/you/sites/project"
}
```

In the example above, requests made to `mysite.dev` will be proxied through to the server running on port 4000 (a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) server, perhaps). Requests made to `project` will be served static files from the directory specified.

You can view your current config using `distra config`:

```bash
$ distra config
mysite.dev        : localhost:4000
project           : /Users/you/sites/project
```

## Tips

### Ports

You can specify the port on which you want distra to start.

`$ distra 1337`

### Portsaway!

I recommend starting on port 80 so you don't have to mess around with ports!

`$ sudo distra 80`

### Tab Completion

If you use bash or zsh, why not bring tears of joy to your eye-holes and enable distra's tab completion?

Just add `. <(distra completion)` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. Hot.
